We will be doing a lot of hacking in this class. There are a few basic data 
structures that we will be using. These are: 
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fields">Fields</A> 
  - a library to simplify input processing 
  <LI><A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Jval">Jvals</A> 
  - a generic data type 
  <LI><A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Dllists">Dllists</A> 
  - a library for doubly-linked lists 
  <LI><A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/JRB">Red-Black 
  Trees</A> - a library for red-black trees </LI></UL>Each of these has a set of 
lecture notes associated with them. You should read each of these to familiarize 
yourself with them. Lab 1 makes you use all of them. 
<P>A few notes: The Dllist library is different from the one that I have used in 
CS360 in the past. The main difference is that it uses jvals rather than void 
stars for its value field. If you are not used to this, go over the lecture 
notes. The old library only had one `l' (``Dlist'' rather than ``Dllist''). Keep 
it in mind in case you see stuff with one `l'. 
<P>The red-black tree library is new as of fall, 1999. I got rid of all those 
disgusting unions and bit fields, and I made the key and val fields jvals. The 
new name for everything is ``jrb'' rather than ``rb''. 
<P>

<H2>Obtaining the Source Code</H2>You can get the source code as a shar file in 
one of three ways: 
<UL>
  <LI>Anonymous ftp to <B>cs.utk.edu</B> in <B>pub/plank/libfdr/libfdr.shar</B>. 

  <LI>At the web link <A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/libfdr/libfdr.shar"><B>href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/libfdr/libfdr.shar</B></A> 

  <LI>Locally at <B>/ruby/homes/ftp/pub/plank/libfdr/libfdr.shar</B>. </LI></UL>Or 
you can get it as a <B>tar</B> file in one of three ways: 
<UL>
  <LI>Anonymous ftp to <B>cs.utk.edu</B> in <B>pub/plank/libfdr/libfdr.tar</B>. 
  <LI>At the web link <A 
  href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/libfdr/libfdr.tar"><B>href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/libfdr/libfdr.tar</B></A> 

  <LI>Locally at <B>/ruby/homes/ftp/pub/plank/libfdr/libfdr.tar</B>. </LI></UL>
<HR>

<H2>Compilation and Linking</H2>To compile your code, you need to use the 
complier flag <B>-I/blugreen/homes/plank/cs360/include</B>. For example, if you 
have included ``fields.h'' and ``dllist.h'' in your program <B>lab1.c</B>, then 
your first compilation step is: <PRE>gcc -g -I/blugreen/homes/plank/cs360/include -c lab1.c
</PRE>That will make <B>lab1.o</B>. Now, when you go to link <B>lab1.o</B> into 
an executable, you need to link with 
<B>/blugreen/homes/plank/cs360/objs/libfdr.a</B>: <PRE>gcc -g -o lab1 lab1.o /blugreen/homes/plank/cs360/objs/libfdr.a
</PRE>As always, you can do all of this in a makefile to make your life easier. 
We will provide makefiles for the first few labs. After that, you'll probably be 
on your own. 
<HR>

<H2>Using libfdr on other systems</H2>If you want to use libfdr.a on other 
systems, copy all the files from <B>/blugreen/homes/plank/src/libfdr</B> and 
type <B>make</B>. That should get you a libfdr.a for your system.
